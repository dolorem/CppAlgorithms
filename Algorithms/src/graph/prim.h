/**
 * prim.h
 * Implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding Minimal Spanning Tree.
 * It starts with a spanning tree containing only one vertex and keeps on adding vertices which aren't already
 * in the tree. They're added in order of increasing distances from the tree.
 * complexity O((V + E) log V)
 * Using Fibonacci Heaps will reduce asymptotic complexity to O(E + V log V) but real execution time may be
 * longer for normal graph size.
 * Each edge contains span field indicating whether it belongs to the computed MST.
 * Function returns weight of the MST.
