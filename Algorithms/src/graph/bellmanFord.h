/**
 * bellmanFord.h
 * Implements Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding shortest paths from a given source in a weighed graph.
 * Edge weighs can be negative.
 * During each iteration every edge is checked. If it can reduce path cost for a vertex, it is reduced.
 * If algorithm keeps correcting distances for some vertices after V - 1 iterations, a cycle of negative weight
 * exists and function returns true.
 * Each vertex's distance from source is kept in field distance, it's predecessor on shortest path to the
 * source is in field ancestor.
 * complexity O(VE)
