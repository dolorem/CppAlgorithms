/**
 * kosajaru.h
 * Kosajaru's algorithm for finding a graph of strongly connected components of another graph.
 * Algorithm uses Depth-first search twice. First time it is done on the original graph and vertices are added
 * to vector<int> visited in order of their post-process times. Then the graph is transposed and searched in
 * order of decreasing post-process times. Each root in depth-first search forest starts new strongly connected
 * component and if an edge between component with greater and lower number is found, it is added to the scc graph.
 * After completion each vertex has number of its SCC in the t field.
 * complexity O(V + E)
